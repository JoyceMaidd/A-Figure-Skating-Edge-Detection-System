# A-Figure-Skating-Edge-and-Motion-Detection-System
**Overview:**

The Figure Skating Edge and Motion Detection System is designed to enhance figure skating training and teaching efficiency by providing accurate edge and motion detection capabilities. The system consists of two components: an edge detection system built with Arduino and infrared distance sensors, and a motion detection system developed in Python using MediaPipe pose landmark detection.

**Edge Detection System:**

- Using Arduino and infrared distance sensors to detect figure skating edges with a precision of 0.01cm
- Implemented real-time data transmission using a Wi-Fi module with TCP/IP for real time data transition

**Motion Detection System:**

- Developed in Python using MediaPipe pose landmark detection and inference with images
- Enables accurate detection of figure skating movements, enhancing training and analysis capabilities
